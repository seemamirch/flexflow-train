/**
 * \brief Holds a pointer into (potentially) remote memory which checks that
 * the memory is local on access.
 *
 * There exist per-device states (i.e., \ref PerDeviceOpState and \ref
 * PerDeviceFFHandle) that need to be created and managed by the central \ref
 * term-controller "controller task". Since these are opaque pointers they
 * can't be safely copied to and from the remote devices, so we instead
 * transfer the pointers back-and-forth between workers and the controller
 * task. To prevent accidentally accessing one of these pointers on the wrong
 * device (as the pointer is only valid in the memory where it was created), we
 * wrap them with \ref DeviceSpecificPtr, which holds the \ref global_device_id_t
 * where the pointer was created, and any attempt to interact with the raw
 * pointer value (i.e., \ref DeviceSpecificPtr::get) checks that the current
 * device matches the original device, and throws a readable error message if
 * it does not.
 *
 * \note \ref DeviceSpecificPtr explicitly does not own the pointer that it holds, leaving
 * lifetime management up to the user of the pointer. If you want a lifetime-managed version,
 * see \ref DeviceSpecific.
